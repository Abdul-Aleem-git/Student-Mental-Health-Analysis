# Student Mental Health Analysis 

A Data Science project analyzing the factors contributing to student depression using a dataset of **27,000+ records**. This project utilizes Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and standardized text columns.
- **Advanced EDA:** Created Heatmaps, Violin Plots, and Distribution charts to find correlations.
- **Machine Learning:** Compared **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest** models.
- **Result:** The Random Forest model achieved **82.7% accuracy** in predicting student depression.

## Tools Used
- Python 3.13
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
